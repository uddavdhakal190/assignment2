Changing the file permissions is relatively straightforward, and there are lots of combination commands that can be used together for more advanced use cases. It’s definitely worth reading the user manual (type man chmod) to view the complete list of its capabilities. Once you start playing around with file permissions, you could even build chmod commands into Automator scripts, for example to run a shell command that contains chmod directives.

There are also several related commands, notably chown which changes the ownership of files and folders – for example you might want to change the ownership of a file to the administrator user.
